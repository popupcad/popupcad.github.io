I am a Wyss Institute Postdoctoral Fellow in Technology Development at Harvard University, where I focus on the design and manufacturing of micro-robots in conjunction with Rob Wood and the Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory.

My research topics include design, manufacturing, kinematics, dynamics and simulation of robots and mechatronic devices. I received my Ph.D. and M.S. in mechanical engineering from Stanford University in 2013 and 2009, respectively, studying the design of underactuated robotic hands under advisor Mark Cutkosky.

I worked from 2004 to 2007 as a systems integration engineer across a variety of industries, focusing on manufacturing and food processing automation. I received my B.S. in mechanical engineering from Northwestern University in 2004.
