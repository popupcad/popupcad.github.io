Overview
========

The Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering invites you to join the popup design challenge. Researchers, students, teams, and individuals are encouraged to submit original popup-inspired or laminate active devices developed with popupCAD.  Examples could include a novel toy design, a life-saving medical device, a new mobile robot, or new types of embedded sensors and actuators that could go in the next big consumer device.

Details
=======

Structure
---------

The contest is entirely web-based; announcements will be posted on the website, and emails and newsletters will be regularly sent out to ensure teams stay on track with up-to-date information. Individual entries are permitted, though we encourage you to work in small teams of 2-5 people; if you already have a team assembled for a project-based class, for example, that is great.

Contest registration is accomplished on the popupCAD website at
[{{site.url}}/contest/register]({{site.url}}/contest/register).

Mentors
-------

If you are a student team, please consider asking your teacher to be your team’s mentor. When you register, you will have the option to include this mentor’s name and email address. Mentors serve several functions: first, they will be a local resource for asking questions about your design. By signing up, they will be signed up to a mentorship email newsletter which will give them advice on how to guide their team. Mentors will also be selected to serve as judges.

If you would like to volunteer to coach or mentor a team, you can sign yourself up separately at

[{{site.url}}/contest/register-mentor]({{site.url}}/contest/register-mentor).

### Checkpoints

To encourage an iterative design process, teams are encouraged to submit their work as it progresses at several checkpoints. To pass checkpoints, teams must update and provide a private link to their website and content in its current form. Each month, we may ask that you focus on updating us on different aspects of your design. *This does not need to be a public site, but teams must provide username/password access to the organizers if it is restricted.*

To pass your team’s checkpoint, please fill out this form:

[{{site.url}}/contest/team-checkpoint]({{site.url}}/contest/team-checkpoint)

Fabrication Grants
------------------

Teams which have completed their checkpoints through November 1 will have the opportunity to request a “Fabrication Grant”. A fabrication grant is intended to help teams with limited budgets or limited access to fabrication tools. The Wyss Institute will donate to the selected
teams electronic cutters which can directly print popupCAD design files for prototyping with a variety of materials.

To request a fabrication grant after the November 1<sup>st</sup> checkpoint, visit this page:

Final Submissions
-----------------

Final submissions will be submitted via team-built websites. Teams pick their own web platform for development and are allowed to restrict public access up to the final submission. The team must provide links and login information at the checkpoints (it is ok for the submissions to be very rough, judging does not take place until the final submission). Final submission includes two things: the public-facing web site and hi-res media content (see media list under evaluation metrics). These websites must provide visitors with all the information about their project. Scoring will be based on the minimum documentation requirements listed under evaluation metrics.

All intellectual property remains the property of the submitter.  By submitting your design, however, you give Harvard University’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering the right to use, remix, post, and share your submitted contest content.  This may be in venues such as promotional emails, posted pictures/videos/design files on the website, etc. 

Please be aware that Harvard has a number of patents in this area.  It is possible that your design may be covered by one of these patents. Harvard encourages not-for-profit research organizations to freely practice these patents for academic research, education and not-for-profit scholarly purposes.  Please contact us if you have any questions about commercial use.

Awards
------

### Collaboration award:

The winning team will receive a direct consultation with the Wyss Institute popup development team to discuss the possibility of further device development, manufacturing, research, and collaboration.

The top three teams will receive “popup cup” trophies built using popupCAD and engraved with their team name and ranking. Each of these teams will also receive a cash award as a token for their accomplishments.

Deadlines & Dates
-----------------

***June 29, 2015:*** Pre-Registration begins. Sign up to the [email list]({{site.url}}/newsletter) to be notified about rule and
deadline updates as they get released throughout the summer. Teachers & sponsors, please [contact]({{site.url}}/contact) us if you would like to participate. Those who register will receive updates on tutorials, examples, demonstrations, exercises, and a gallery of popupCAD parts which can be used in the lab and classroom.

***September 15:*** Challenge Registration begins. Register early to participate in checkpoints and receive additional point awards. Identify who are your team members and mentor. It is ok to register without knowing what project you intend to create. If you are a student, you should speak with your teacher to see if you can make a laminate device in your fall design class. Think about what materials you want to use, think about acquiring some, playing with it, exploring the challenges, and learning popupCAD!

***October 30:*** Early registration closes. Teams who register and participate in checkpoints receive bonus awards.

***November 1:*** **Checkpoint 1.** The team provides a project website with rough drafts of documentation and media content. Feedback provided. The team should be able to provide a concept description and sketch to demonstrate the idea. Fabrication grant requests are due. Fabrication grants awarded the following day.

***November 15:*** **Checkpoint 2.** The team provides an updated project website with 2<sup>nd</sup> drafts of documentation and media content. Feedback provided. The team should have made several prototypes to demonstrate the idea.

***December 1:*** **Checkpoint 3.** The team provides an updated project website with near complete drafts of documentation and media content. Feedback provided. The team should have the final prototypes in mind for the final submission.

***December 10:*** Late registration closes. Teams which register only participate in the final submission and do not receive checkpoint bonus
awards.

***December 15:*** Final Submissions Due, see evaluation metrics for required website documentation and media content.

***January 15:*** Awards Announced.

Judges
------

Judges will be selected from team mentors and experts in the field.
