How do you develop a new mechanism from scratch?  How do you get the intuition you need to be able to understand whether a fold pattern will generate the type of motion you want?  This tutorial will take you through some techniques to get your mind thinking like a laminate device designer.

Prototype, prototype, prototype!
=======

I often find that the easiest way to get a new device that moves the way I want is to work with my hands and create prototypes with the materials around me.  You can get a stack of 500 sheets of origami paper on [amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=origami+paper) really cheap, and then start folding and testing your ideas.

Let's Try!
==========

Take a sheet of paper and fold it like this:

[<img src="{{site.url}}/file.jpg" height = "30px" />](file.jpg)

This sequence produces a set of six bodies each separated from its neighbor by a "fold", or in robotics terms, a "joint".  [<img src="{{site.url}}/images/tutorial/drawing1.svg" height = "50px" />]({{site.url}}/images/tutorial/drawing1.svg)  If you take one end of the sheet of paper and move it with respect to the other, you'll find you have created a fundamental component in mechanism theory: the ball joint!

Fun Fact:
-----

The ball joint is a three-degree-of-freedom element which allows two bodies to rotate in all three directions with respect to each other.  Try rotating the right side around in place!
