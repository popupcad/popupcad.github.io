title: Mentors

If you are a student team, please consider asking your teacher to be your team’s mentor. When you register, you will have the option to include this mentor’s name and email address. Mentors serve several functions: first, they will be a local resource for asking questions about your design. By signing up, they will be signed up to a mentorship email newsletter which will give them advice on how to guide their team. Mentors will also be selected to serve as judges.

If you would like to volunteer to coach or mentor a team, you can sign yourself up separately at
