popupCAD is divided into several main windows.  When you open popupCAD, the editor will be your main interaction. It is how you create and work with laminate geometries through different laminate operations.  The sketcher is a tool which gives you access to single-layer geometries, as well as dimensioning and constraining functions.  To learn more, please visit:
