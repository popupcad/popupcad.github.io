Hello, this is a test

my relative directory is {{collection.relative_directory}}

My collection is {{page.collection}}

I have this many files {{page.files}}

My name is {{page.name}}

My title is {{page.title}}

{% for operation in page.operations %}

* [<img src="{{operation.image_file}}" height = "75px" />]({{operation.image_file}}) **{{ operation.name }}** {{operation.description}} [{{operation.cut_file}}]({{operation.cut_file}})

{% for output in operation.outputs %}
  * [<img src="{{output.image_file}}" height = "50px" />]({{output.image_file}}) **{{output.name}}** {{output.description}} [{{output.cut_file}}]({{output.cut_file}})

{% endfor %}
