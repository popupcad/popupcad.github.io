PopupCAD was recently [featured](http://www.betaboston.com/news/2015/09/29/flat-packed-foldable-3-d-printed-robots-could-teach-kids-to-code/) in the Boston Globe!  It discussed popupCAD's use in the classroom, focusing on the Harvard Graduate School of Design ["Informal Robotics"](http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/media/sci-06478-informal-robotics-new-paradigms-for-design.html) class being taught this fall.  This is a collaboration with Chuck Hoberman  at the GSD and the Wyss Institute, intended to teach design students how to make things using material which is coming out of the Harvard Microrobotics Lab and others.  Check it out!
