In windows, you can install the compiled [msi](https://sourceforge.net/projects/popupcad/) here.  Newer Windows systems may complain about .msi files, but we don't have an alternative at this point.

Alternatively, popupCAD source code can run on [Windows]({{site.url}}/docs/windows-setup-source), [Mac]({{site.url}}/docs/mac-setup), and [Linux]({{site.url}}/docs/linux-setup).  Please check out their respective pages for more information on how to install the respective code bases.  Please [contact]({{site.url}}/contact) us with any problems with the respective instructions.  Variations in systems abound, and we are not likely to catch them all.

If you want to look at the code, visit the [github repository](https://github.com/danaukes/popupcad).
