Installing Windows Compiler ================

Here's the steps:

> Download and install specifically Visual Studio C++ 2008 Express
> Edition.

> Update for x64 Compilers: By default this will only give you a 32-bit
> compiler. I learned (from here and here) that you can download
> specifically the Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 3.5 SP1
> which gives you a x64 compiler for VC++ 2008 (VC++ 9.0) if you need
> it. Just when you are installed it, you can uncheck everything except
> Developer Tools &gt;&gt; Visual C++ Compilers which will keep you from
> installing all the extra SDK tools that you may not need.

"c:program files (x86)microsoft visual studio 9.0vcbinvcvarsxx.bat" works in my case.

:   64-bit Compilers:

    > "C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Visual Studio
    > 9.0Common7Toolsvsvars64.bat"

    Note: Yes, the native 64-bit compilers are in Program Files (x86).
    Don't ask me why. Additionally, if you are wondering what the
    difference between vcvars64.bat and vcvarsx86\_amd64.bat or more
    importantly the difference between amd64 and x86\_amd64, the former
    are for the native 64-bit compiler tools and the latter are the
    64-bit cross compilers that can run on a 32-bit
    Windows installation.

Update:

:   If for some reason you are getting error: ... was unexpected at
    this time. where the ... is some series of characters, then you need
    to check that you path variable does not have any extraneous
    characters like extra quotations or stray characters. The batch file
    is not going to be able to update your session path if it can't make
    sense of it in the first place.
