popupCAD updates
----------------

You may not notice(that's the idea in software development, generally), but some work has been going on to make popupCAD more compatible across operating systems.  This has focused on adapting popupCAD to all the flavors of QT available through python, including pyQT4, pyQT5, and PySide, which was the only one supported in the past.  This should make popupCAD future-proof and more compatible with distributions like anaconda.  More info on that soon.
