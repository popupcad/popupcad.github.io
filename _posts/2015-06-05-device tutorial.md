Making a five-layer device
========================



Step 1: Get Materials
-------------

See the materials page for to get ideas for types of materials and how to cut them out.  But let's assume you're doing something fairly straightforward like Cardboard, Polyester, and Adhesive

Step 2: Prepare your cutfiles
-------------

If you are cutting a layer with a backing on it, such as a double-sided adhesive sheet, you need to think about what side the backing is on, and what side you want it to stick to first.  You can solve this issue two ways: flip the image in your image editing program or printer before you cut, or flip the sheet in the cutter so that the backing is upside down or right side up.  If you're cutting layers of the same material out at the same time,  and if one layer is supposed to be backing-facing-up and the other backing-facing-down, you will **have** to mirror one layer in your image editor first so they both have the backing on the right side.

Step 3: Cut Out your layers
-------------

Cut settings are a particularly tough problem, because depending on the method you are using to cut out your materials, the settings are entirely machine dependent, and take a lot of trial and error

Each layer must be cut out.  

Step 4: Stack and Align your layers
