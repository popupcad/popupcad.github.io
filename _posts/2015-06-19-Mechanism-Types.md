The most basic element in origami is the fold.  But as you can see, you can make a variety of other mechanisms with it!

6 Degree of Freedom Mechanisms
-----------
Two rigid bodies, free to move in 3-dimensional space, have at most six degrees of freedom between each other. That means it takes only six numbers to represent the position of one rigid body with respect to any other.  This corresponds to three positional coordinates, such as x,y, and z Cartesian coordinates, and three rotational coordinates, such as roll, pitch, and yaw.
