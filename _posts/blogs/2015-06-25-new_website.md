As you can see, the website has gone through a transformation lately.  This is in anticipation of a summer of code development, tutorial rollouts, and classroom content we hope to build in preparation for the popup contest to be announced at the end of the month.  

We are hoping that the website will become a central repository for information regarding the design and fabrication of laminate devices.  Upcoming updates will include a new gallery design(that dynamically updates as designs change), as well as more complete information not just on how to use popupCAD, but how to build the devices you want to make.

In terms of classroom content, we hope to provide teachers in undergraduate classes some materials which they can integrate into a design class.  We think there are a lot of things about laminates --  including geometry, kinematics, programming, and other concepts in manufacturing -- which would push kids to learn in order to design cooler robots.

Stay tuned, and please join our [newsletter]({{site.url}}/newsletter)!
