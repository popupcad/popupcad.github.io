As part of the popup design challenge, we are pleased to announce that we have updated the license for popupCAD.  We have switched to the MIT license, which should allow **anyone** to use the software as they see fit.  We hope you will make something amazing, beautiful, functional, revolutionary!

Do you have an application which is similar to the laminate design concept, but not quite?  Does popupCAD help you, but not fully?  Is there another button you wish existed?  [Contact]({{site.url}}/contact) us to see if we're already working on it, or check out the code to make a contribution!

The code is available on [GitHub]({{site.popupcad_source_path}}), and we already have had a couple users help out, adding new functionality for display, simulation, and export.  We would love to have you participate even further!
