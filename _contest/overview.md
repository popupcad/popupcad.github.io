The Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering invites you to join the popup design challenge. Researchers, students, teams, and individuals are encouraged to submit original popup-inspired or laminate active devices developed with popupCAD.  Examples could include a novel toy design, a life-saving medical device, a new mobile robot, or new types of embedded sensors and actuators that could go in the next big consumer device.

Structure
---------
The contest is entirely web-based; announcements will be posted on the website, and emails and newsletters will be regularly sent out to ensure teams stay on track with up-to-date information. Individual entries are permitted, though we encourage you to work in small teams of 2-5 people; if you already have a team assembled for a project-based class, for example, that is great.

Registration
------------
Contest registration is accomplished on the popupCAD website at
