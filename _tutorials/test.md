============

popupCAD is software which enables a variety of geometric operations on
laminate geometries, or ordered sets of geometry defined for each layer
of material in a composite or laminate device. This is facilitated by
giving users access to the ability to draw or import two-dimensional
geometry and manipulate it through the use of sketches.
