For 64-bit Windows, you can install the [windows msi]({{site.popupcad_windows_installer_path}}) here.  Newer Windows systems may complain about .msi files, but we don't have an alternative at this point.

Alternatively, popupCAD source code can run on [Windows]({{site.url}}/docs/windows-setup-source), [Mac]({{site.url}}/docs/mac-setup), and [Linux]({{site.url}}/docs/linux-setup).  Please check out their respective pages for more information on how to install the respective code bases.  Please [contact]({{site.url}}/contact) us with any problems with the respective instructions.  Variations in systems abound, and we are not likely to catch them all.

If you want to look at the code, visit the [github repository]({{site.popupcad_source_path}}).
