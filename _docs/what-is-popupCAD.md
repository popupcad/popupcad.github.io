What is popupCAD?
=================
popupCAD is a program which makes it incredibly easy to make multi-layer design files.  popupCAD designs generally end up being cut out by a laser cutter, 3D printer, or CNC Mill.

How does it work?
=================
popupCAD allows you to operate between all of your design layers at once, using standard constructive solid geometry(CSG) operations.  Operations such as union, intersection, and difference form the core of how you create new geometries from existing ones.

How do I create my first laminate?
==================================
You can draw or import a sketch, and then apply that sketch to whatever layers you want.  You can draw a sketch using the sketch tool, which allows you to create accurately dimensioned polygons and lines.
