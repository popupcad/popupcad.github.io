Teams which have completed their checkpoints through November 1 will have the opportunity to request a “Fabrication Grant”. A fabrication grant is intended to help teams with limited budgets or limited access to fabrication tools. The Wyss Institute will donate to the selected
teams electronic cutters which can directly print popupCAD design files for prototyping with a variety of materials.
