title: Judging Criteria
---
There are a number of factors which will determine a successful project.  The following categories will be important factors in the final judging criteria.  Therefore, as you begin to plan your project, make sure you identify how you will accomplish the following things:

Documentation
=============
Provides clear, thorough documentation which enables others to understand and build this design.  This includes:

* Idealized design documentation, including renderings, popupCAD files, and CAD files
* Process documentation, including pictures of important fabrication steps
* High-definition photos and if possible, videos of final device
* A Prototyped device is highly encouraged. Show it moving, walking, flying...

Soneone else should be able to **make** your device!

Originality
===========
Original research, previously unpublished. Think something that would fit really well in a special edition of a peer-reviewed scientific journal!

Design / Aesthetic
==================
Contributes to understanding the aesthetic possibilities of this new medium.  Something beautiful, something architectural, something functional!

Manufacturing Contribution
==========================
Introduces new manufacturing processes, uses laminate analysis techniques on existing or new processes, adds new analysis methods or algorithms, augments popupCAD with new functionality or plugins.  Also measure scale of manufacturing complexity. Depth of analysis.

Content
=======
Contributes new designs and popupCAD files for components or subcomponents.  This can be something as simple as a joint design for a new type of laminate layup, or perhaps could be as complex as a reusable leg mechanism for a walking robot.
