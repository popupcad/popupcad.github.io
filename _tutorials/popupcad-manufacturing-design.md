1. Sheet operation - creates the original sheet before subtraction
1. Scrap operation (select sheet and device) - creates scrap material.  

  This gives you scrap you can remove from above, below, and both
1. Support Design (laser, device) - bridges gap between support and gap
1. Merge final device, scrap, and support to get cut files
1. Cut line is your release cut, use cut area to check --> subtract from sheet
1. Identify bodies helps you check connectivity
