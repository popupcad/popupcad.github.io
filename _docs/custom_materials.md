title: Custom Materials in popupCAD
---

It is possible to customize materials in popupCAD.  This can be done by putting a materials file in the user popupcad directory(c:/users/YOUR_USERNAME/popupcad_files/ in windows, ~/popupcad_files/ in linux & mac).  This file is in a human-readable, human-editable .yaml format, which you can edit to create a custom material list.

An example file can be found [here]({{site.url}}/assets/scripts/materials.yaml).
