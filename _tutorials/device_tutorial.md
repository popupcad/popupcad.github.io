Making a five-layer device
========================

Step 1: Get Materials
-------------

See the [materials](materials) page for to get ideas for types of materials and how to cut them out.  But let's assume you're doing something fairly straightforward like Cardboard, Polyester, and Adhesive.

###Layer Order:

1. Structural
1. Adhesive
1. Flexible
1. Adhesive
1. Structural

Your typical five-layer laminate is arranged with each material in the following configuration. To create a laminate which can be used to create linkages, it's important that you pick materials which are compatible with each other. For example, if you are using nylon as your flexible layer, you must ensure that the adhesive you pick can stick both to it and the structural layer.  We have created [recipes](recipes) of materials which work together, so you don't have to go through an extensive materials search.

Step 2: Prepare your cutfiles
-------------

If you are cutting a layer with a backing on it, such as a double-sided adhesive sheet, you need to think about what side the backing is on, and what side you want it to stick to first.  You can solve this issue two ways: flip the image in your image editing program or printer before you cut, or flip the sheet in the cutter so that the backing is upside down or right side up.  If you're cutting layers of the same material out at the same time,  and if one layer is supposed to be backing-facing-up and the other backing-facing-down, you will **have** to mirror one layer in your image editor first so they both have the backing on the right side.

Step 3: Cut Out your layers
-------------

Cut settings are a particularly tough problem, because depending on the method you are using to cut out your materials, the settings are entirely machine dependent, and take a lot of trial and error.

Step 4: Stack and Align your layers
-------------

It is often helpful to create alignment geometry directly in the cutfiles, so that once each layer is cut out the first time, you can use this geometry to stack everything together.  This can be as simple as aligning the outer rectangle of each layer, or you can cut circular holes and align them.
