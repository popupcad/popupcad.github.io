title: Checkpoints
---

To encourage an iterative design process, teams are encouraged to submit their work as it progresses at several checkpoints. To pass checkpoints, teams must update and provide a private link to their website and content in its current form. Each month, we may ask that you focus on updating us on different aspects of your design. *This does not need to be a public site, but teams must provide username/password access to the organizers if it is restricted.*

To pass your teamâ€™s checkpoint, please fill out this form:

[{{site.url}}/contest/team-checkpoint]({{site.url}}/contest/team-checkpoint)
