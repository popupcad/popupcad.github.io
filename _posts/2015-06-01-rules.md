Originality
===========
Original research, previously unpublished, to go into a special edition of a peer-reviewed journal

Design / Aesthetic
==================
Contributes to understanding the aesthetic possibilities of this new medium.

Manufacturing Contribution
==========================
Introduces new manufacturing processes, uses laminate analysis techniques on existing or new processes, adds new analysis methods or algorithms, augments popupCAD with new functionality or plugins.  Also measure scale of manufacturing complexity. Depth of analysis.

Content
=======
Contributes new designs and popupCAD files for components or subcomponents.  This can be something as simple as a joint design for a new type of laminate layup, or perhaps could be as complex as a reusable leg mechanism for a walking robot.

Documentation
=============
Provides clear, thorough documentation which enables others to understand and build this design.  This includes:

- Idealized design documentation, including renderings, popupCAD files, and CAD files
- Process documentation, including pictures of important fabrication steps
- High-definition photos and if possible, videos of final device
- A Prototyped device is highly encouraged
