# To do

- logo - next!
DONE: - Frontpage video and placeholder appear to stack on mobile.
- Color and font-size of mobile menu are really iffy. lets also move it to the top.
- 'our tutorials are a great..' etc on a front page is not good on mobile (!)
- give the same form styles to http://localhost:4000/newsletter/ that /contact has.
DONE: - github doesnt have an icon in the footer or main page. i must have removed it by accident from fontello. put it back!
- the top right menu spills over on tablet. make it more responsive.
- the circular share icons spill over on mobile, make it more responsive.
- page and post .alpha should have less vertical padding on mobile.
- tweak h1-h6 sizes on mobile. perhaps 2rem. theyre 20% too small.
- center tutorial/gallery/docs h1 and h2 in .alpha on mobile
DONE: - change the phone icon next to /contact in footer to a mail icon.
DONE: - add a custom.css file for Dan's overrides, so his changes can be instant, and so we can integrate later.
