We are announcing a design contest based around the laminate design techniques outlined on this website.  The goal is to use the contest to grow the community of people who can design, build, and operate laminate devices and micromechanisms.  If you are a student considering using popups for your class project, if you are a researcher who has an application for a new robot, or if you simply want to learn about the process, then consider submitting your design to the contest!
